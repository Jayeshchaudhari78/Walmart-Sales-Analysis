# Walmart-Sales-Analysis
Predict the weekly sales of walmart stores by section using historical sales, markdown data and macro-economic indicators

# Overview:
Developed a comprehensive data science project to predict the weekly sales of Walmart stores by section using historical sales data, markdown data, and macro-economic indicators. The project involved extensive data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the implementation of machine learning models for predictive analytics.

# Data Collection and Preparation:

Gathered and combined datasets, including historical sales data, store information, and features data (macro-economic indicators).
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure consistency and handle missing values.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted univariate and bivariate analyses to understand the distribution and relationships of the variables.
Visualized trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify key insights and correlations.

# Feature Engineering:

Created new features based on the existing data to enhance the model's predictive power.
Analyzed the trend of variables with respect to the dependent variable (weekly sales).

# Modeling:

Implemented Random Forest Regression to predict weekly sales, leveraging its ability to handle large datasets and complex interactions between features.
Applied ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for time series forecasting to capture temporal patterns in sales data.

# Model Comparison:

Compared the performance of different models to determine the best approach for accurate sales prediction.
Evaluated models based on key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

# Discussion and Conclusion:

Summarized findings and discussed the implications of the results for Walmart's sales strategy.
Provided recommendations for future improvements and potential areas for further research.

# Technologies and Tools:

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, statsmodels

Models: Random Forest Regression, ARIMA

# Project Outcome:

Successfully developed a predictive model that accurately forecasts weekly sales for Walmart stores, aiding in better inventory management and strategic planning. The project demonstrated strong analytical and technical skills, with a focus on data-driven decision-making.
